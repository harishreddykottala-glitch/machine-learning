# Simple PyTorch Neural Network Model

This repository contains a basic PyTorch neural network implemented using `torch.nn.Sequential`.  
It demonstrates a minimal feedforward neural network with one hidden layer

##  Model Architecture

The model consists of:

  Input Layer: 2 features  
  Hidden Layer: 4 neurons with ReLU activation  
  Output Layer: 1 neuron (suitable for regression or binary classification)
